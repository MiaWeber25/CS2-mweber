Class keyword
	vs Struct
public, private, protected
	scope of the variable
const
	Understand the use of const in the parameter list vs
	  const between ) { of the function implementation.
friend
	There is not secret "this" parameter

ostream vs ofstream vs cout
	Inheritance
ostream vs ifstream vs cin
	Inheritance
	
insertion operator <<
	--- Temporaririly forget it can shift
extraction operator >>

class A {
};

class B:public A {
};

subclass, superclass, use of :: to specify which function and data to access
Derived classes

class A {
  public:
  void foo() {
  }
};

class B:public A {
  void foo() {
     A::foo();
  }
};


class A {
  int num;
  public:
  A(int x=10) {
    num=x;
  }
  void output(ostream &out){
   out << num;
  }
};

class B:public A {
  B(int y=0):A(y) {
  }
};

... in main
B b(11);
b.output(cout);

recursion
	2 requirements for recursion
		1   Calls itself  (if indirectly)
		2	A clear stopping condition
	fib
	integration
	tic-tac-toe (game possibilities) 

C  Fair Game Easy Points
	pass by reference
	pass by value
	scope of a variable

Reading code
		compiled so no errors
		give example similar in nature but not identical to ones 
		from class
		ostream insertion <<
			overloading for purposes of output
		istream extraction >>
			overloading for purposes of input

Look like a kattis but without the hard thinking
